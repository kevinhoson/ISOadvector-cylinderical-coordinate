# ISOadvector-cylinderical-coordinate
The code to realise the isoadvector in 2d's cylinderical coordinate

IsoAdvector is a geometric Volume-of-Fluid method for advection of a sharp interface between two incompressible fluids. It works on both structured and unstructured meshes with no requirements on cell shapes. IsoAdvector is meant as a replacement for the interface compression with the MULES limiter implemented in the interFoam family of solvers.
It's designed for the unstruct mesh and struct mesh for openfoam.
this part of code is to realise it's idea in the two dimensional cylinderical coordinate.
of cource the code is written by fortran instead of C++
